You can find it on a certain cat website.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- imagemagick (for `level` and `spreads` command)
- exiftool (for `releases`, optional)

## Scripts
This repo also have a module or script to release and split stuff up.

To install, you need git since I'm not publishing this to PyPi.
After that you can run this:

```sh
pip install -U git+https://github.com/noaione/nao-manga-rls.git@module-rewrite#egg=nmanga
```

This will install this project which then you can use the command `nmanga` to execute everything.

### Commands

#### `autosplit`
Same as the old auto split script, this will ask a series of question where you can automatically split the content of a volume archive into a chapters archives (cbz format).

It will ask for the file `Manga Title` then the `Publisher` (if there is chapter title).

The regex should match something like this:
- `Manga Title - c001 (v01) - p001 [dig] [Chapter Title] [Publisher Name?] [Group] {HQ}.jpg`
- `Manga Title - c001 (v01) - p000 [Cover] [dig] [Chapter Title] [Publisher Name?] [Group] {HQ}.jpg`
- `Manga Title - c001 (v01) - p000 [Cover] [dig] [Publisher Name?] [Group] {HQ}.jpg`
- `Manga Title - c001 (v01) - p001 [dig] [Publisher Name?] [Group] {HQ}.jpg`

This should match most of the release from a certain cat website (`danke`, `LuCaZ`, `1r0n`, etc.)

#### `level`
Automatically batch color level an archive or folder containing images.<br />
This can be useful to some VIZ release since sometimes the "black" color is not really that "black" (ex. `#202020` instead of `#000000`)
